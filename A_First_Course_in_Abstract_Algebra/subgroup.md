# Subgroups
**Definition**: If a subset $H$ of a [[group]] $G$ is [[closure|closed]] under the [[binary_operation|binary operation]] of $G$ and if $H$ forms a group under the induced operation from $G$, the $H$ is a *subgroup* of $G$.

We denote the subgroup $H$ of $G$ by $H \leq G$.

If $G$ is a group,
- The subgroup $G$ is called the *improper subgroup* of $G$.
- The subgroup $\{e\}$ is called the *trivial subgroup* of $G$.
- All other subgroups of $G$ are called *proper subgroups*.

A nonempty subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if for all $a, b \in H$, $ab^{-1} \in H$.

A finite nonempty subset $H$ of $G$ is a subgroup if and only if $H$ is closed under the binary operation of $G$.
