# Groups
**Definition**: A *group* $\langle G, * \rangle$ is a set $G$ [[closure|closed]] under a [[binary_operation|binary operation]] $*$ such that the following axioms hold:
1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
2. **Identity**: There exists an element $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$, $e * a = a * e = a$.
3. **Inverses**: For each $a \in G$, there exists an element $b \in G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$.

There is only one identity element in a group, and each element has only one inverse.

The *left* and *right cancellation laws* hold in groups, in other words, if $a * b = a * c$ or $b * a = c * a$, then $b = c$.

IF $G$ is a group with binary operation $*$, and if $a$ and $b$ are elements of $G$, then the linear equations $a * x = b$ and $y * a = b$ have unique solutions in $G$.

For $a, b \in G$, $(a * b)' = b' * a'$.
