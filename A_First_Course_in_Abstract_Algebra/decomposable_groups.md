# Decomposable Groups
**Definition** A group $G$ is **decomposable** if it is isomorphic to the direct product of two proper nontrivial subgroups. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**.

The finite indecomposable [[abelian_group|abelian group]] are exactly the [[cyclic_group|cyclic groups]] of prime order. Related: [[fundamental_theorem_of_finitely_generated_abelian_groups|Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups]].

If $m$ divides the [[group_order|order]] of a finite abelian group $G$, then $G$ has a subgroup of order $m$. 

If $m$ is a squre-free integer (not divisible by the square of any integer $n \geq 2$), then every abelian group of order $m$ is cyclic.
