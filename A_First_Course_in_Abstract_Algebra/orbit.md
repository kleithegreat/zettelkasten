# Orbit
**Definition (permutations)**: Let $\sigma \in S_A$ be a [[set_permutation|permutation]] of a set $A$ and $a \in A$. The *orbit* of $a$ under $\sigma$ is the set $\{\sigma^k(a) \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.

**Definition (group action)**: Let $X$ be a $G$[[group_action|-set]]. Each cell in the partition of $X$ defined by $x_1 \sim x_2$ if there exists $g \in G$ such that $g x_1 = x_2$ is called an *orbit* of $X$ under $G$. If $x \in X$, the orbit of $x$ is denoted by $Gx = \{gx \mid g \in G\}$.
