# Binary Operations
**Definition**: A *binary operation* on a set $S$ is a function mapping $S \times S$ to $S$. For each $(a, b) \in S \times S$, we denote the element $*((a, b))$ by $a * b$.

We typically use additive notation for [[abelian_group|Abelian groups]] and multiplicative notation for [[group|Groups]] that may or may not be Abelian.
