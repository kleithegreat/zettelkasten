# Coset
**Definition**: Let $H$ be a [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] $G$. The subset $aH = \{ah \mid h \in H\}$ of $G$ is the *left coset* of $H$ in $G$ containing $a$.

The *right coset* of $H$ in $G$ containing $a$ is defined as $Ha = \{ha \mid h \in H\}$.

The cardinality of the left coset $aH$ is equal to the cardinality of $H$.

If $\phi: G \to G'$ is a [[group_homomorphism|group homomorphism]], then the left and right cosets of $\ker(\phi)$ are identical. Furthermore, $a, b \in G$ are in the same coset of $\ker(\phi)$ if and only if $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$. Related: [[kernel]].

A homomorphism $\phi: G \to G'$ is *injective* if and only if $\ker(\phi) = \{e\}$.
