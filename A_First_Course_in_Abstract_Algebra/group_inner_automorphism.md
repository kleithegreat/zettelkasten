# Inner Automorphisms of a Group
**Definition**: An [[isomorphism]] $\phi: G \to G$ is called an *automorphism* of the [[group]] $G$.

**Definition**: The automorphism $i_g: G \to G$ where $i_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$ for all $x \in G$ is called the *inner automorphism* of $G$ by $g$. Performing $i_g$ on $x$ is called *conjugation* of $x$ by $g$.

A subgroup being [[normal_subgroup|normal]] is equivalent to being invariant under all inner automorphisms.
