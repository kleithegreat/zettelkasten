# Cyclic Group
**Definition**: A [[group]] $G$ is *cyclic* if there is an element $g \in G$ that [[group_generator|generates]] $G$.

Every cyclic group is abelian, but not every abelian group is cyclic.

A [[subgroup]] of a cyclic group is cyclic.

All cyclic groups are [[group_isomorphism|isomorphic]] to either $\langle \mathbb{Z}, + \rangle$ or $\langle \mathbb{Z}_n, + \rangle$ if the group has finite order $n$.

If $G$ is a cyclic group and $N$ is a [[normal_subgroup|normal subgroup]] of $G$, then $G/N$ is cyclic.
