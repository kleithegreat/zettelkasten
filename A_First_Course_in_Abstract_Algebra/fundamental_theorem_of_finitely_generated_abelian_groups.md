# Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups
**Primary Factor Version**: Every [[group_generating_set|finitely generated]] [[abelian_group|Abelian group]] $G$ is [[group_isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a direct product of [[cyclic_group|cyclic groups]] of the form
$$ \mathbb{Z}_{(p_1)^{r_1}} \times \mathbb{Z}_{(p_2)^{r_2}} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{(p_n)^{r_n}} \times \mathbb{Z}^k $$
where $p_i$ are primes, not necessarily distinct, and the $r_i$ are positive integers. The direct product is unique up to the order of the factors and the **Betti number** $k$.

**Invariant Factor Version**: Every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form
$$ \mathbb{Z}_{d_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{d_n} \times \mathbb{Z}^k $$
where $d_i \geq 2$ are integers and $d_i$ divides $d_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n-1$. The numbers $d_i$ are called the **invariant factors** or **torsion coefficients** of the group.
