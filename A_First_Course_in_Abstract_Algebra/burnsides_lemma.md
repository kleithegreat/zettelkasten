# Burnside's Lemma
**Statement**: Let $G$ be a finite group and $X$ a finite $G$[[group_action|-set]]. If $r$ is the number of [[orbit|orbits]] in $X$ under $G$, then
$$ r \cdot |G| = \sum_{g \in G} |X_g|.$$

Corollary: If $G$ is a finite group and $X$ is a finite $G$-set, then the number of orbits in $X$ under $G$ is given by
$$ \frac{1}{|G|} \cdot \sum_{g \in G} |X_g|.$$
