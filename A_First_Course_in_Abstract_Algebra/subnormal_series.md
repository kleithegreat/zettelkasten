# Subnormal Series of Groups
**Definition**: A *subnormal* (or subinvariant) *series of a [[group]]* $G$ is a finite sequence $H_0, H_1, \ldots, H_n$ of [[subgroup|subgroups]] of $G$ such that $H_i < H_{i+1}$ and $H_i$ is a [[normal_subgroup|normal subgroup]] of $H_{i+1}$ with $H_0 = \{e\}$ and $H_n = G$.

In other words, $\{e\} = H_0 \triangleleft H_1 \triangleleft H_2 \triangleleft \cdots \triangleleft H_n = G$ is a subnormal series of $G$.

A subnormal/[[normal_series|normal]] series $\{K_j\}$ is a *refinement* of a subnormal/normal series $\{H_i\}$ of a group $G$ if $\{H_i\} \subseteq \{K_j\}$, in other words, if each $H_i$ is one of the $K_j$.

Two subnormal/normal series $\{H_i\}$ and $\{K_j\}$ of the same group $G$ are *isomorphic* if there is a bijection between the collections of [[quotient_group|factor groups]] $\{H_{i+1}/H_i\}$ and $\{K_{j+1}/K_j\}$ such that the corresponding factor groups are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]].
