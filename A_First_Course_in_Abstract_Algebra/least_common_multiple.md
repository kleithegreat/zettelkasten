# Least Common Multiple
**Definition**: Let $r_1, \ldots r_n$ be positive integers. Their *least common multiple* is the positive [[group_generator|generator]] of the [[cyclic_group|cyclic group]] of all common multiples of $r_1, \ldots r_n$, that is the cyclic group of all integers divisible by each $r_1, \ldots r_n$.

Let $(a_1, \ldots, a_n) \in \prod_{i=1}^n G_i$. If $a_i$ is of finite [[group_element_order|order]] $r_i$ in $G_i$, then the order of $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ in $\prod_{i=1}^n G_i$ is the least common multiple of the $r_i$.
