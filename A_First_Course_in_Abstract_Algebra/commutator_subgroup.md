# Commutator Subgroup
**Definition**: An element $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ of a [[group]] $G$ is called a *commutator* of the group.

**Definition**: Let $G$ be a group. The set of all commutators $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ for $a,b \in G$ is called the *commutator subgroup* $C$ of $G$.

The commutator subgroup $C$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.

If $N$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, then $G/N$ is abelian if and only if $C \leq N$.
