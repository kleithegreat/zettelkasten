# Abelian Group
**Definition**: A [[group]] is called **Abelian** if the group [[binary_operation|operation]] is [[commutativity|commutative]]. That is, for all $a, b \in G$, we have $a * b = b * a$.

Every group of [[group_order|order]] $p^2$ is Abelian (for a prime $p$). Related: [[center_subgroup|center]], [[cyclic_group|cyclic group]].
