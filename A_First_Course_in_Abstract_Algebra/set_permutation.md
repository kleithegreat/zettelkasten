# Set Permutation
**Definition**: A permutation of a set $A$ is a bijection $\phi: A \to A$.

Any permutation of a finite set can be written as a product of transpositions.

A permutation is *even* or *odd* depending on whether it can be expressed as a product of an even or odd number of transpositions, respectively.

No permutation can be even and odd.

We define the *sign* of a permutation $\text{sgn}: S_n \to \{1, -1\}$ as
$$\text{sgn}(\sigma) = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \sigma \text{ is even} \\
-1 & \text{if } \sigma \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}.$$
