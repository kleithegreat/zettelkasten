# Lagrange's Theorem
**Statement**: Let $H$ be a [[subgroup]] of a finite [[group]] $G$. Then the [[group_order|order]] of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

Corollary: Every group of prime order is [[cyclic_group|cyclic]].

THe [[group_element_order|order]] of any element of a finite group divides the order of the group.
