# Quotient Group
**Definition**: Let $H$ be a [[normal_subgroup|normal subgroup]] of a group $G$. The *quotient group* $G/H$ is the set of [[coset|left cosets]] of $H$ in $G$, with the [[binary_operation|operation]] defined by $(aH)(bH) = abH$ for all $a, b \in G$. The [[identity]] element of $G/H$ is the coset $H$, and the [[inverse]] of a coset $aH$ is the coset $a^{-1}H$.

If $H \trianglelefteq G$, then $\gamma: G \to G/H$ given by $\gamma(x) = xH$ is a [[group_homomorphism|homomorphism]] with kernel $H$.
