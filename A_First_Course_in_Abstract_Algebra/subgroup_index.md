# Index of a Subgroup
**Definition**: Let $H$ be a [[subgroup]] of a [[group]] $G$. The *index* of $H$ in $G$, denoted $(G:H)$, is the number of distinct left cosets of $H$ in $G$.

By [[lagranges_theorem|Lagrange's Theorem]], given $H$ and $K$ are subgroups of a group $G$ such that $H \leq H \leq G$ and $(H:K)$, $(G:H)$ are finite, then $(G:K)$ is finite and is equal to $(G:H)(H:K)$.
