# First Sylow Theorem
**Statement**: Let $G$ be a finite [[group]] and let $|G| = p^n m$ where $n \geq 1$ and $p$ is a prime that does not divide $m$. Then,
- $G$ contains a [[subgroup]] of order $p^i$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$.
- Every subgroup $H$ of $G$ of order $p^i$ is a [[normal_subgroup|normal subgroup]] or a subgroup of order $p^{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i < n$.
