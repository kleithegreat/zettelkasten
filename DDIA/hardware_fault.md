# Hardware Fault
A *hardware fault* is a specific type of [[fault]] where a physical component of a system does not function as intended.

Examples:
- Hard disk failure (mean time to failure is 10-50 years)
- Memory corruption
- Network failure
- Power supply issues

Hardware faults will happen commonly if you have a lot of machines.

Typical solutions involve redundancy, such as:
- RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) for hard disk failures
- ECC (Error-Correcting Code) memory for memory corruption
- Network redundancy (e.g., multiple network interfaces)
- Dual power supplies
- Hot-swappable CPUs
- Backup diesel generators
