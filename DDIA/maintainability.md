# Maintainability
*Maintainability* refers to the ease with which a system can be modified.

Typically the majority of the cost of software is not in the initial development, but in the ongoing maintenance and evolution of the system. There are three strategies to improve maintainability:
- **Operability**: Make it easy to keep the system running smoothly
- **Simplicity**: Make it easy for new developers to understand the system
- **Evolvability**: Make it easy to change the system for unanticipated future requirements
