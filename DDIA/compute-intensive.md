# Compute-Intensive Applications
A *compute-intensive application* is one where the limiting factor is the raw CPU power required to perform computations, rather than the data related aspects.

The opposite of a compute-intensive application is a [[data-intensive|data-intensive application]], where the limiting factor is the amount of data, complexity of data, or the speed at which data changes.
