# Data Systems
A *data system* is a building block of a [[data-intensive|data-intensive application]]. Some examples include:
- Databases
- Caches
- Message queues
- Data warehouses
- Search indexes
- Stream processing
- Batch processing

Certain technologies do not necessarily need to fit into a single category. For example:
- Redis is primarily a cache, but it can also be used as a message queue or a database.
- Apache Kafka is primarily a message queue, but it also has database-like durability.
