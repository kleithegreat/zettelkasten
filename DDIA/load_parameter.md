# Load Parameters
A *load parameter* is a numeric value with a unit that describes one aspect of the load on a [[data-intensive|system]].

Some examples of load parameters include:
- Requests per second to a web server
- Ratio of reads to writes in a database
- Number of concurrent users in a chat room
- Hit rate of a cache

Sometimes the average case is the most important, but other times the bottleneck may be a small number of extreme cases.
