# Linear Independence
**Definition**: A [[lists|list]] of vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ in a vector space $V$ is *linearly independent* if the only solution to the equation
$$ c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 + \ldots + c_n v_n = 0 $$
is $c_1 = c_2 = \ldots = c_n = 0$.

The empty list is defined to be linearly independent.

A list is linearly dependent if it is not linearly independent.

Linear dependence lemma: Given a linearly dependent list, one vector is in the [[span]] of the preceding vectors.

Every [[subspaces|subspace]] of a [[span|finite-dimensional]] vector space is finite-dimensional.
