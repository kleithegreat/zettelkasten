# Linear Maps
**Definition**: A *linear map* from $V$ to $W$ is a function $T: V \to W$ such that
- additivity: $T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v)$
- homogeneity: $T(cu) = cT(u)$

Linear map lemma: A linear map is completely determined by its action on a [[basis]] of $V$.

Linear maps preserve the zero vector: $T(0) = 0$.

We denote $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ as the vector space of all linear maps from $V$ to $W$.

The [[dimension]] of $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ equals $\dim V \cdot \dim W$.
