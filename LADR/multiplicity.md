# Multiplicity
**Definition**: The *multiplicity* of an [[eigenvalue]] $\lambda$ of $T$ is defined to be the [[dimension]] of the corresponding [[generalized_eigenspaces|generalized eigenspace]] $E(\lambda, T)$, or in other words, $\dim \text{null}\;(T - \lambda I)^{\dim V}$.

For $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$, the sum of multiplicities of the eigenvalues of $T$ is equal to $\dim V$.

The multiplicity of an eigenvalue is the number of times it appears on the diagonal of the [[upper_triangular_matrices|upper triangular matrix]] of $T$ with respect to some [[basis]] of $V$. Related: [[characteristic_polynomial|Characteristic Polynomial]].

The upshot: algebraic multiplicity is the power of $(x - \lambda)$ in the characteristic polynomial, and geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda$.
