# Polynomial Division Algorithm
The integer division algorithm states that for any integers $a$ and $b$ with $b \neq 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that $$ a = qb + r $$ where $0 \leq r < |b|$.

**Statement**: Suppose $p, s \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$ with $s \neq 0$. Then there exist unique polynomials $q, r \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$ such that $$ p = sq + r $$ where $\text{deg}\; r < \text{deg}\; s$.
