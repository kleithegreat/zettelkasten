# Nilpotent Operators
**Definition**: An operator is called *nilpotent* if some power of it equals 0.

For all nilpotent operators $T$ over $V$, $T^{\dim V} = 0$.

[[eigenvalue|Eigenvalues]] of a nilpotent operator:
- 0 is an eigenvalue, and the only eigenvalue
- if $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$ and 0 is the only eigenvalue, the $T$ is nilpotent

For a nilpotent operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$, the following are equivalent:
- The [[minimal_polynomial|minimal polynomial]] of $T$ is $z^m$ for some positive integer $m$.
- There is a [[basis]] of $V$ where the [[matrices|matrix]] of $T$ is [[upper_triangular_matrices|upper triangular]] with all diagonal entries equal to 0.

If $T$ is nilpotent, then $I + T$ has a [[square_root|square root]].

Every nilpotent operator has a [[jordan_form|Jordan basis]].
