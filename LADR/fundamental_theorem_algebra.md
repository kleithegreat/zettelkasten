# Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
Multiple equivalent statements:
- Every nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root.
- If $p \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{C})$ is a nonconstant polynomial, then $p$ has a unique factorization (except for the order of the factors) of the form $$ p(z) = c(z - \lambda_1) \cdots (z - \lambda_n) $$ where $c, \lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n \in \mathbb{C}$.
