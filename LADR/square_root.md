# Square Root of an Operator
**Definition**: An operator $R$ is called a *square root* of an operator $T$ if $R^2 = T$.

If $T$ is [[nilpotent_operators|nilpotent]], then $I + T$ has a square root.

If $T$ is [[invertibility|invertible]] over a [[complex_numbers|complex]] vector space, then $T$ has a square root.
