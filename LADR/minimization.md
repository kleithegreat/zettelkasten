# Minimization Problems
Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional [[subspaces|subspace]] of $V$, $v \in V$, and $u \in U$. Then
$$ \|v - P_U v\| \leq \|v - u\| $$
with equality if and only if $u = P_U v$.

The projection matrix onto the range of a matrix $A$ is given by
$$ P_{\text{range}\;A} = A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T $$
