# Eigenvector
**Definition**: Let $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$ an [[eigenvalue]] of $T$. A vector $v \in V$ is an *eigenvector* of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ if $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$.

Every list of eigenvectors of $T$ is [[linear_independence|linearly independent]].

An operator cannot have more eigenvectors than the [[dimension]] of the vector space.

The *eigenspace* of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ is the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of $\lambda$.

The sum of eigenspaces is a [[direct_sum|direct sum]].
