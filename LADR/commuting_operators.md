# Commuting Operators
**Definition**: Two operators $S$ and $T$ *commute* if $ST = TS$.

The [[matrices]] of commuting operators commute as well.

If $S, T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ commute and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$, then $E(\lambda, S)$ is [[invariant_subspace|invariant]] under $T$.

Two [[diagonalizability|diagonalizable]] operators have diagonal matrices with respect to the same [[basis]] if and only if they commute.

Every pair of commuting operators on a finite-dimensional nonzero [[vector_space|vector space]] has a common [[eigenvector]].

If $V$ is a finite-dimensional [[complex_numbers|complex]] vector space and $S, T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ commute, then there is a basis of $V$ where $S$ and $T$ are both represented by [[upper_triangular_matrices|upper triangular matrices]].

If $V$ is a finite-dimensional complex vector space and $S, T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ commute, then
- Every eigenvalue of $S + T$ is an eigenvalue of $S$ plus an eigenvalue of $T$.
- Every eigenvalue of $ST$ is an eigenvalue of $S$ times an eigenvalue of $T$.
