# Sums of Subspaces
**Definition**: Suppose $V_1, \ldots, V_m$ are [[subspaces]] of $V$. The *sum* $V_1 + \ldots + V_m$ is the set of all possible sums of vectors from the subspaces.

$$ V_1 + \ldots + V_m = \{ v_1 + \ldots + v_m : v_i \in V_i \text{ for } i = 1, \ldots, m \} $$

The sum of subspaces is the smallest subspace containing all contributing subspaces.
