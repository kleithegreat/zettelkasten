# Generalized Eigenvectors
**Definition**: Suppose $T \in L(V)$ and $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$. A vector $v \in V$ is called a *generalized eigenvector* of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ if $v \neq 0$ and $$ (T - \lambda I)^k v = 0 $$ for some positive integer $k$.

Suppose $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$ and $T \in L(V)$. Then there is a [[basis]] of $V$ consisting of generalized eigenvectors of $T$.

Each generalized eigenvector corresponds to only one eigenvalue.

Every list of generalized eigenvectors of $T$ is [[linear_independence|linearly independent]].
