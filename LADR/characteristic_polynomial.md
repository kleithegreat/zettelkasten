# Characteristic Polynomial
**Definition**: Suppose $\mathbb{F} = \mathbb{C}$ and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Let $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_m$ denote the distinct [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] of $T$ with [[multiplicity|multiplicities]] $d_1, \ldots, d_m$. The [[polynomials|polynomial]]
$$ (z - \lambda_1)^{d_1} \cdots (z - \lambda_m)^{d_m} $$
is called the **characteristic polynomial** of $T$.

The [[characteristic_polynomial|characteristic polynomial]] of $T$ has degree $\dim V$.

The zeros of the characteristic polynomial are the eigenvalues of $T$.

The characteristic polynomial is a polynomial multiple of the [[minimal_polynomial|minimal polynomial]] of $T$.
