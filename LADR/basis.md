# Bases
**Definition**: A *basis* of a [[vector_space|vector space]] $V$ is a [[lists|list]] of vectors in $V$ that is [[linear_independence|linearly independent]] and [[span|spans]] $V$.

A list is a basis of $V$ if and only if every vector in $V$ can be written as a *unique* [[linear_combination|linear combination]] of the vectors in the list.

Every spanning list can be reduced to a basis.

Every linearly independent list can be extended to a basis.

Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis.

Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors.
