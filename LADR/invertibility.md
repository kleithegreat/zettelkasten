# Invertibility
**Definition**: A linear map $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ is *invertible* if there exists a linear map $S \in \mathcal{L}(W, V)$ such that $ST = \text{id}_V$ and $TS = \text{id}_W$. 

In this case, we say that $S$ is the *inverse* of $T$, denoted by $T^{-1}$.

An invertible linear map has a unique inverse.

A linear map is invertible if and only if it is a bijection.

If $\dim V = \dim W$, then [[null_space|injectivity]] and [[range|surjectivity]] are equivalent.
