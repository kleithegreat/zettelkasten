# Lists
**Definition**: A *list* of length $n$ is an ordered collection of $n$ elements.

Lists are only equal if they are the same length and have the same elements in the same order.

We denote $\mathbb{F}^n$ as the set of all lists of length $n$ with elements from the field $\mathbb{F}$.

Lists by definition have *finite* length.
