# Matrices
**Definition**: An $m$ by $n$ matrix is a rectangular array of scalars with $m$ rows and $n$ columns.

The entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is denoted by $a_{ij}$.

The **column rank** of a matrix is the dimension of the column space, which is the span of the columns of the matrix.

The **row rank** of a matrix is the dimension of the row space, which is the span of the rows of the matrix.

Column rank and row rank are equal.

The **rank** of a matrix is the column rank.

The **transpose** of a matrix $A$ is denoted by $A^T$ and is obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of $A$. In other words, $(A^T)_{ji} = A_{ij}$.
