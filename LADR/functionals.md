# Linear Functionals
**Definition**: A linear functional on $V$ is a linear map $f: V \to \mathbb{F}$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the underlying field of $V$.

The *dual space* of $V$, denoted $V^*$, is the vector space of all linear functionals on $V$.

**Theorem** (Riesz Representation Theorem): If $V$ is a finite-dimensional inner product space and $\phi$ is a linear functional on $V$, then there exists a unique vector $v \in V$ such that
$$ \phi(u) = \langle u, v \rangle $$
for all $u \in V$.
