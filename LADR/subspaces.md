# Subspaces
**Definition**: A *subspace* $U$ of a vector space $V$ is a subset of $V$ that has the same additive identity, addition, and scalar multiplication as $V$.

A subspace must satisfy the following conditions:
- Includes the zero vector
- Is closed under vector addition
- Is closed under scalar multiplication

Every subspace $U$ of $V$ is part of a [[direct_sum|direct sum]] equal to $V$.
- $V = U \oplus W$ for some subspace $W$ of $V$
