# Direct Sums
**Definition**: Suppose $V_1, \ldots, V_m$ are [[subspaces]] of $V$.
- The sum $V_1 + \ldots + V_m$ is a *direct sum* if each element of $V_1 + \ldots + V_m$ can be written uniquely as a sum $v_1 + \ldots + v_m$ with $v_i \in V_i$.
- If $V_1 + \ldots + V_m$ is a direct sum, we write $V = V_1 \oplus \ldots \oplus V_m$.

A sum is direct if and only if the only way to write $0$ as a sum $v_1 + \ldots + v_m$ with $v_i \in V_i$ is to have each $v_i = 0$.

If $U \oplus W$ is a direct sum then $U \cap W = \{0\}$.

A sub of subspaces is direct if and only if $\dim V_1 + \ldots + \dim V_m = \dim (V_1 + \ldots + V_m)$.
