# Span
**Definition**: The set of all [[linear_combination|linear combinations]] of a list $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ is called the *span* of $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ and is denoted by $\text{span}(v_1, \ldots, v_m)$.

The span of the empty list defined as $\{0\}$.

The span of a list of vectors is the smallest subspace that contains all the vectors in the list.

A [[vector_space|vector space]] is finite-dimensional if some [[lists|list]] of vectors spans the space.
