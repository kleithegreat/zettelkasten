# Jordan Form
**Definition**: Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. A basis of $V$ is called a *Jordan basis* for $T$ if with respect to this basis $T$ has a block diagonal matrix
$$ \begin{pmatrix} A_1 & & 0 \\ & \ddots & \\ 0 & & A_p \end{pmatrix} $$
in which each $A_k$ is an [[upper_triangular_matrices|upper triangular matrix]] of the form
$$ A_k = \begin{pmatrix} \lambda_k & 1 & & 0 \\ & \ddots & \ddots & \\ & & \ddots & 1 \\ 0 & & & \lambda_k \end{pmatrix}. $$

Every [[nilpotent_operators|nilpotent]] opreator has a Jordan basis.

Every operator $T$ over a [[complex_numbers|complex]] vector space $V$ has a Jordan basis.
