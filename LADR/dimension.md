# Dimension
**Definition**: The *dimension* of a finite-dimensional vector space is the length of any basis for the space.

If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a [[subspaces|subspace]], then $\dim U \leq \dim V$.

Every [[linear_independence|linearly independent]] list of vectors in $V$ of length $\dim V$ is a basis for $V$.

If $V$ is finite-dimensional then every spanning list of length $\dim V$ is a [[basis]] for $V$.

If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ where $\dim U = \dim V$, then $U = V$.

If $V_1$ and $V_2$ are subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector space, then the dimension of their [[subspace_sum|sum]] is
$$ \dim(V_1 + V_2) = \dim V_1 + \dim V_2 - \dim(V_1 \cap V_2) $$
