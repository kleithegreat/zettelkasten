# Self-Adjoint Operators
**Definition**: An operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is *self-adjoint* if $T = T^*$.

Every [[eigenvalue]] of a self-adjoint operator is real.

$T$ is self adjoint if and only if $\langle Tv, v \rangle$ is real for all $v \in V$.

Suppose $T$ is self-adjoint on $V$, then
$$ \langle Tv, v \rangle = 0 \; \text{for all} \; v \in V \iff T = 0. $$
This REQUIRES $T$ to be self-adjoint, however this is not to say that the only operators with this property are the self adjoints. If $T$ is not self-adjoint, then $V$ must be complex for this to hold. Over $\mathbb{R}$, non self-adjoint skew-symmetric (transpose equals its negative) operators can have this property.
