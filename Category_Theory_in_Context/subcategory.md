# Subcategory
**Definition**: A *subcategory* $\mathsf{D}$ of a category $\mathsf{C}$ is defined by restricting to a subcollection of objects and subcollection of morphisms subject to the requirements that the subcategory $\mathsf{D}$ contains
- the domain and codomain of any morphism in $\mathsf{D}$
- the identity morphism of any object in $\mathsf{D}$
- the composite of any two composable morphisms in $\mathsf{D}$.
