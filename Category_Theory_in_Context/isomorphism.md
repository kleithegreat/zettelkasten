# Isomorphism
**Definition**: An *isomorphism* in a [[category]] is a morphism $f: X \to Y$ for which there exists a morphism $g: Y \to X$ such that $gf = 1_X$ and $fg = 1_Y$.

Two objects $X$ and $Y$ are said to be *isomorphic* if there exists an isomorphism between them. In this case, we write $X \cong Y$.
