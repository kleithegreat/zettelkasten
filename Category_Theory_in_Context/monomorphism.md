# Monomorphism
**Definition**: A morphism $f: x \to y$ in a [[category]] is a *monomorphism* if for any parallel pair of morphisms $h, k: w \to x$, $fh = fk$ implies $h = k$.

A monomorphism is called *monic*, and is the [[opposite_category|dual]] of an [[epimorphism]].

A set theoretic analogue of a monomorphism is an injective function.
