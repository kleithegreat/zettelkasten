# Section (right inverse)
**Definition**: Suppose that $x \xrightarrow{s} y \xrightarrow{r} x$  are morphisms so that $rs = 1_x$. The map $s$ is a *section* or *right inverse* of $r$.

The map $s$ is always a [[monomorphism]], and to acknowledge the one-sidedness of the inverse, $s$ is called a *split monomorphism*.
