# Opposite Category
**Definition**: Let $\mathsf{C}$ be any [[category]]. The *opposite category* $\mathsf{C}^{\text{op}}$ has
- the same objects as $\mathsf{C}$, and
- a morphism $f^{\text{op}}$ in $\mathsf{C}^{\text{op}}$ for each morphism $f$ in $\mathsf{C}$ so that the domain of $f^{\text{op}}$ is the codomain of $f$ and the codomain of $f^{\text{op}}$ is the domain of $f$.

The syntactical duality of categories has an important consequence in that any theorem about categories can be dualized to obtain a theorem about opposite categories.
