# Concrete Category
**Definition**: A *concrete [[category]]* is one whose objects have underlying sets and whose morphisms are functions between those underlying sets, typically the "structure respecting" morphisms.

Alternate definition: A *concrete category* is a category $\mathsf{C}$ equipped with a [[faithful_functor|faithful functor]] $U: \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{Set}$.
