# Groupoid
**Definition**: A *groupoid* is a [[category]] in which every morphism is an [[isomorphism]].

A group $G$ (or more generally a monoid) defines a category $\mathsf{B}G$ with a single object. The group elements are its morphisms, each group element representing a distinct [[endomorphism]] of the single object, with composition given by multiplication. The identity element $e \in G$ acts as the identity morphism.
