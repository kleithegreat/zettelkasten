# Retraction (left inverse)
**Definition**: Suppose that $x \xrightarrow{s} y \xrightarrow{r} x$  are morphisms so that $rs = 1_x$. The map $r$ is a *retraction* or *left inverse* of $s$.

The maps $s$ and $r$ express the object $x$ as a *retract* of the object $y$.

The map $r$ is always a [[epimorphism]], and to acknowledge the one-sidedness of the inverse, $r$ is called a *split epimorphism*.
